Minimum Number of Workers
Difficulty: Medium

You are given an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the range of working hours a person at position i can cover.
If arr[i] ≠ -1, the person at index i can work and cover the time interval [i - arr[i], i + arr[i]].
If arr[i] = -1, the person is unavailable and cannot cover any time.
The task is to find the minimum number of people required to cover the entire working day from 0 to n - 1. If it is not possible to fully cover the day, return -1.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The person at index 1 can cover the interval [-1, 3]. After adjusting to valid bounds, this becomes [0, 3], which fully covers the entire working day 0 to n -1. Therefore, only 1 person is required to cover the whole day.

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 0, 0, -1, 0]
Output: -1
Explanation: Persons up to index 2 cover interval [0…6], but working hour 7 cannot be cover as arr[7] = -1, Since the 7th hour cannot be covered by any person, it is impossible to cover the full working day.

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, -1]
Output: -1
Explanation: The last hour cannot be covered by any person, so it is impossible to cover the full working day.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤10^5
-1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ arr.size()

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
